# Vesting for WOW platform
![Vesting Schedule](Vesting-diagram.png?raw=true) <br />
This contract implements token vesting and claiming for the specified list of beneficiaries.
Vested tokens unlocked: **daily / monthly** after the cliff period ended.

The aim of this project is to distribute ERC20 WOW Tokens to the list of beneficiaries.
Contract can hold multiple pools, however - **the listing date for all pools is the same.**

# The WOW Wealth Protocol
Tokens will be available for claiming in the [Wealth Of Wisdom plaftorm](https://wealthofwisdom.io/wow-token/). 
Every purchase of a WOW Token contributes directly to the wealth protocol, a pool of capital allocated to finance promising projects that have the potential to shape the future of technology, sustainability, and decentralized finance. This unique model ensures that WOW Token holders are directly connected to the success of these ventures when they stake their tokens.

## Vesting pool data
Vesting pools can be added in the constructor or separately in addVestingPoolFunction.<br />
Example data for pools:

| Vesting Pool          | Tokens      | Listing %  | Cliff release % | Cliff period (months) | Vesting                                              |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| NFT Holders           | 8,000,000  | 10 %         | 15 %           | 24                     | Mothly                        |
| Community Sale 0.005               | 100,000  | 5 %         | 0 %           | 24                     | Monthly                        |
| Whitelist Sale 0.001             | 21,000,000  | 55 %         | 10 %           | 18                     | Daily   |

## Beneficiary Parameters

| Parameter   | Type      | Explanation                                                                    |

| addresses   | address[] | Beneficiary wallet addresses                                                   |
| tokenAmount | uint256[] | Amounts of tokens that can be claimed by beneficiaries. absolute token amount! |

Token amount for beneficiary is recalculated this way: **Total amount = Listing amount + Cliff amount + Vesting amount**

### Claiming tokens
Beneficiaries can claim tokens from the selected pools
- **If listing has started** : listing token amount;
- **If cliff has ended** : listing token amount + cliff token amount + vested unlocked tokens: 
 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?unlockedTokens&space;=&space;listingAmount&space;&plus;&space;cliffAmount&space;&plus;&space;\frac{vestingAmount&space;*&space;periodsPassed}{duration}" /><br />
- **If vesting period ended** : transfer all allocated and unclaimed tokens.

## Deployment logic
•	We deploy a separate **Vesting.sol** and a TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol contract (latter is OpenZeppelin standard and is uploaded using [truffle-upgrades plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openzeppelin/truffle-upgrades) (code is not stored in the repository as we use the standard library).
